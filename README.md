Analyzing the Energy-Related Carbon Emissions in the U.S.

The United States on average produced 6.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. Through our project, we have attempted to analyze the exact sources of these emissions, and the sectors and states which contributed most to them over the period of 1980 to 2018.
