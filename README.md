# Carbon-Emission-Analysis
### Analyzing the Energy-Related Carbon Emissions in the U.S.

The United States on average produced 6.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. Our goal with this project is to research and evaluate the energy-related carbon emissions (total GHG) across US sectors over the past few years. The emissions from fossil fuels, such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum, are referred to as "energy-related." The "Unites States Energy Information Administration" provided the project with the dataset, which covered the years 1980 through 2019. The information includes more details on sub-sectors within each of the five main sectors (Commercial, Industrial Process, Residential, Transportation, and Electricity) as well as the energy-related carbon emissions in each.
